# Module 4 Portfolio Project Proposal

## Overview

We will soon introduce the requirements for your _Personal Portfolio Project_.

Much like in Module 2, you will have the freedom to choose the topic for your application.

This time, you'll create a **Full Stack Application** using the PERN stack.


This proposal will serve as a starting point for your ideas and plans.

\*\* **You must submit a proposal and receive approval from an instructor prior to working on your project.**

## Proposal Requirements:

The following requirements must be included in your proposal:

1. **Topic/Idea** -- can be a title w/ a short description

Run the Ropes - A website dedicated to introducing people to the world of professional wrestling while also having a place for more experienced fans to search for their favorite wrestlers in a clear and orderly manner.

1. **3 User Stories** minimum, describing what a user can expect to see/do when using your application

MVP:
1. The user can see a list of wrestlers (alphabetical sorting will be attempted).
2. The user can click on a wrestler to see more information on that wrestler such as their debut date, birthday, stats, etc.
3. The user can add a wrestler to the website.
4. The user can delete a wrestler.
5. The user can update a wrestler's information.

Stretch Goals:
1. The user can search for a wrestler using a search bar.
2. The user can filter their searches by certain categories.
3. The user can create a list of their favorite wrestlers by click a favorite button. This should persist. They can also remove a favorite wrestler from their list.
4. The user can see a landing page with three options: one for new fans and an option to simply go to the site. The new fan option will list out some categories that most new wrestling fans find intriguing and upon clicking one of the categories, wrestlers that fit that category will show up. 
5. The user can leave comments on wrestler's pages that persist. 
6. The user can see a "Featured Wrestlers" section on the main page with a list of random wrestlers.

1. **Wireframes** -- a lo-fidelity visual representation of your front-end using whatever tools you choose. (even pencil and paper)

1. **ERD** for your back-end. Only **one** table is required, but you must add all columns that are expected for each entry to your table(what info does an entry have?)
_For example: a user may have id, name, email, phone_
