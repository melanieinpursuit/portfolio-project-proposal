# Module 4 Portfolio Project Proposal

## Overview

We will soon introduce the requirements for your _Personal Portfolio Project_.

Much like in Module 2, you will have the freedom to choose the topic for your application.

This time, you'll create a **Full Stack Application** using the PERN stack.


This proposal will serve as a starting point for your ideas and plans.

\*\* **You must submit a proposal and receive approval from an instructor prior to working on your project.**

## Proposal Requirements:

The following requirements must be included in your proposal:

1. **Topic/Idea** -- can be a title w/ a short description

1. **3 User Stories** minimum, describing what a user can expect to see/do when using your application

1. **Wireframes** -- a lo-fidelity visual representation of your front-end using whatever tools you choose. (even pencil and paper)

1. **ERD** for your back-end. Only **one** table is required, but you must add all columns that are expected for each entry to your table(what info does an entry have?)
_For example: a user may have id, name, email, phone_

Your proposal is to be submitted AFTER the Portfolio Project Requirements and Repo have been shared with you in class. Please submit your proposal in a **group message with JD && Carlos** via Slack.
